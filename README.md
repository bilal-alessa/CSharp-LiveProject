<h1>C# and Asp.Net Live Project</h1>


<h3>Introduction</h3
  
<p>While I was involved in the Live C# Project, I worked along side a team of others and a projects manager to develop an interactive website for a local theatre in Portland. The site was being built from the ground up and I was tasked to add specific features or redesign certain pages entirely. </p>
